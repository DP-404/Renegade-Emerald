# Pokémon Renegade Emerald

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

[travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/pret/pokeemerald.svg?branch=master

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald with many added features and gameplay changes.

The unmodiffied decomp repo can be found [here](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).

This project also uses some features of the [RHH expansions](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion).

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## WARNING

This project is in an early stage of development. Most of the features have not been implemented yet. From time to time a preview version will be [released](https://github.com/rglezg/Renegade-Emerald/releases).

## What is this

Pokémon Renegade Emerald aims to be a more complex and difficult version of the original GBA game, with some unique machanics and an important number of QoL changes. The list of all planned/implemented features can be found [here](https://github.com/rglezg/Renegade-Emerald/issues/7), but the most important conditions the game must meet are the following:

- All Pokémon and items are obtainable an unlimited number of times without trading or cheating. This doesn't mean it will be easy to do so ;)
- The game forces you to, literally, "catch 'em all" or almost all. That's because each HM is obtained by completing a speciffic amount of entries in the Pokédex.
- Pokémon can use HM moves without learnig them. All you need is a Pokémon compatible with the move, the HM disk, and the badge that allows you to use it outside of battle. Also HM moves can be forgotten by learning new moves.
- Friendship plays a bigger role in the evolution and trading of Pokémon. All evolutions methods are changed to be friendship-dependant. Of course, trading evolution methods have been removed.
- Defeating a Pokémon does not gives yours EVs. Instead, every time a Pokémon levels up, you will be asked to select a stat to increase its EVs. The amount of points earned depends on factors as the friendship of your Pokémon, and the average level of enemies it have defeated from the last time it leveled up. This allows you to train your party while you progress in the game instead of force you to kill a lot of Poochyenas before battling the first trainer XD
- All battles in the game (including wild encounters) are double battles.
- Trainers are more difficult to beat and have more diverse teams.
- Pokémon of newer generations have been added. This initialy include all evolutions and pre-evolutions of the original 386 that appeared in later games, but can include other species (?).
- Pokémon stats and moves are balanced to make them all equally viable in battle.

## What is this NOT

Instead of copy-pasting all Pokémon/items/mechanics found in the newer generations or in other Pokémon Hacks, I want to make this my own way, so Renegade Emerald will not have:  

- Mega-evolutions, dynammax, etc..
- All the existent Pokémon species
- A new story with new characters
- Reusable TMs, infinite steps in Safari Zone, or other ways of get for free something that have a cost in the original game.

I will update this list as other unwanted features come to my mind.
